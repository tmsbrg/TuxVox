"""Audio chime feedback for TuxVox experimental mode.

Plays short, non-blocking event sounds so the user gets clear cues for
dictation start/stop without needing to look at (or focus) a window.  This
is important for inline mode where any focus-stealing overlay would prevent
text from being typed into the target application.

Sounds are played via ``canberra-gtk-play`` (freedesktop event sounds) with
a fallback to various command-line audio players.  All
playback is fire-and-forget; failures are logged at debug level and never
raised.
